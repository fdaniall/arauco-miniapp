## üöÄ HOW TO DEPLOY (3 SIMPLE STEPS)

### Step 1: Deploy Contract (2 minutes)
```bash
./deploy-mainnet.sh
```
- Deploys TreeNFT to Base Mainnet
- Auto-verifies on BaseScan
- Outputs contract address

### Step 2: Update Address (30 seconds)
```bash
./update-contract-address.sh 0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```
- Updates .env file
- Shows Vercel instructions

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend (3 minutes)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to mainnet"
git push
```
- Vercel auto-deploys
- Live at https://arauco.space

**TOTAL TIME: ~6 minutes** ‚ö°

## üéØ WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option 1: Deploy Everything (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Deploy contract
./deploy-mainnet.sh

# 2. Copy contract address from output

# 3. Update address
./update-contract-address.sh 0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS

# 4. Update Vercel env vars (see READY_TO_DEPLOY.md)

# 5. Deploy frontend
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Base Mainnet"
git push
```

### Option 2: Test Build First
```bash
# Build contract to verify
forge build

# Run tests
forge test

# Then proceed with Option 1
```

### Option 3: Deploy Contract Only
```bash
# Just deploy contract first
./deploy-mainnet.sh

# Test it manually on BaseScan
# Then deploy frontend later
```
